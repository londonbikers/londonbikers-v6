Welcome {0}!

You've joined the biggest and best community for bikers in and around London. To get the most out of being a member we've got some suggestions that might help you:

								
- Introduce yourself
Say hi and let us know what you're riding in our Newbies Forum (https://londonbikers.com/forums/5/newbies).
									
- Come to one of our newbie meets
Posting in the newbie forum is a great way to have everyone see you've arrived. We also host a monthly newbie night at the famous Ace Cafe on the first Monday of the month from 6pm.
									
- Come to our weekly bike meet
We've had our own bike meet at Borough Market (Stoney Street) since 2007. You can find us there every Wednesday evening after work. Come along!
									
- Go on a ride-out
There's always ride-outs, track-days and road trips being organised. Check out the Events Forum (https://londonbikers.com/forums/6/ride-outs) often to make sure you don't miss a great day out.
